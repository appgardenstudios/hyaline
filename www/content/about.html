        <p class="mb-4">
          Hyaline is an intelligent documentation maintenance tool that helps
          software development teams keep their documentation current, accurate,
          and accessible. It automatically identifies when code changes require
          documentation updates, verifies that documentation match their
          intended purpose, and provides seamless integration with AI
          development workflows.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">Key capabilities include:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Automated change detection</strong>: Analyzes code diffs to
            identify documentation that needs updates
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Purpose validation</strong>: Ensures your documentation

          Who Built Hyaline?
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Hyaline is developed by

            class="text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-700"
            >App Garden Studios</a
          >, a team of seasoned software engineers and technical leaders with
          decades of combined experience across startups and enterprise
          organizations. We've architected systems, led engineering teams, and
          experienced firsthand the productivity costs of outdated
          documentation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our team understands the technical challenges of maintaining
          documentation at scale, from monorepos to distributed microservices,
          and we've built Hyaline to solve these problems systematically.

          Our Vision for Hyaline
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          We're building the documentation tooling that modern development teams
          need. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into development
          workflows, having well-structured, accessible documentation becomes
          critical. Hyaline bridges this gap by:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>
            Enabling you to use your documentation regardless of where it's
            located
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensuring AI tools can access and utilize your documentation
            effectively
          </li>
          <li>
            Verifying that critical documentation exists and covers what your
            team actually needs
          </li>
          <li>
            Keeping documentation current so your documentation remain a
            reliable source of truth
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Documentation should be a force multiplier for your team, not a
          maintenance overhead.

          How Do You Pronounce Hyaline?
        </h2>
        <p>
          We pronounce it "HIGH-uh-leen" â€“ meaning clear and transparent, just
          like we want your documentation to be.
