title: "Purpose"

# Purpose
* Have you ever witnessed a conversation where someone says “make sure to update the documentation”, and then …

# What is purpose
* Purpose is defined as “...”. Describe and define purpose and how we are using it here
* When we say purpose this is what we mean (for the sake of this article)

# Why does documentation need a purpose
* Describe what happens when documentation does not have a purpose, or that it appears that it does not need a purpose
* What people think or are willing to do (or not do) based on it having a purpose (If I don’t see the purpose, or the point, I won’t bother doing it)

# Who needs to understand/know the purpose?
* Thinking about documentation, there are 3 main categories of people involved: Directors, Producers, and Consumers
* Directors - will it solve problem x, will it return an ROI, is it worth it
* Producers - What do we need to document, and how
* Consumers - Will this document answer my question

# When should the purpose of a piece of documentation be established?
* Ideally before it is written, but in reality as soon as you can
* If you have documentation and it isn’t being updated, ask yourself what the purpose is. Sometimes the purpose no longer exists, or sometimes no one left knows the purpose.

# How to "discover" a purpose for a piece of documentation
* Identify and write down the problem or situation. “Person X needs to Y to do Z but cannot” “When X happens Y needs to be able to Z”, etc…
* Identify and write down the possible solution(s). “If X existed Y would be able to Z. And that would solve the initial problem or solution by …”
* Based on the problem/situation and possible solutions, extract the set of Consumers
* For each consumer, list out what they would need to know (this is what you need to document)
* Based on the why and who, identify the what (persona X needs to do Y, so they should be able to read about Z)
* Put that all together: Document X so that Person Y can do Z
* Refine/expand X, Y, and Z. X will turn into a series of documents or sections, Y may split into 2 different personas with different needs, and Z may split into a list of things that need to be able  to be done.
* Note purpose at each level of X
* Examples of clear purposes

# Where should the purpose of the documentation be stored
* That is going to be dependent on your organization, but can you guess what that list of purpose(s) is? You’re right, it is documentation.
# Examples
* Run Locally section in a README
* Documentation of an API used internally
* Documentation of a feature in a SaaS app?
