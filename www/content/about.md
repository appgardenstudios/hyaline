# What is Hyaline?
Hyaline is a tool for software development teams to find, fix, and prevent documentation issues.

# Who built Hyaline?
Hyaline is built by me, John Clark. I have been a software engineer for almost 2 decades and have served in several roles such as developer, architect, team lead, and CTO across a wide variety of companies. I currently live near silicon slopes in Utah, USA.

# How do I contact you?
You can contact me directly via email at john@hyaline.dev.

# What are your plans for Hyaline?
I built Hyaline to solve a problem I have had at every company I have worked at: how the heck do you create and maintain really good documentation that allows you to excel at building rock solid and valuable products, especially in organizations that have grown past the size where implicit tribal knowledge still works.

I plan to continue developing and (eventually) selling Hyaline as a solution to that problem. I personally dislike licensing schemes that discourages a company from growing and organizing themselves in the way that makes the most sense to them. To that end I intend to provide a license that is not seat or size based if at all possible. I also intend to be as reasonable as possible when providing Hyaline to startups, non-profits, and others in need. If you want to chat about pricing or anything else feel free to shoot me an email and lets talk!

# How do you pronounce Hyaline?
Google says /ˈhīələn,ˈhīəˌlīn/, while I tend to use a longer "e" like "hyaleen". Either way it means "a thing that is clear and translucent like glass, especially a smooth sea or a clear sky."
