# About Hyaline

## What is Hyaline?

Hyaline is a documentation maintenance tool that helps software development teams keep their documentation current, accurate, and accessible. It automatically identifies when code changes require documentation updates, verifies that documentation match their intended purpose, and provides seamless integration with AI development workflows.

Key capabilities include:

- **Automated change detection**: Analyzes code diffs to identify documentation that needs updates
- **Purpose validation**: Ensures your documentation actually serves its stated goals
- **AI-ready data extraction**: Makes your documentation easily accessible to AI assistants through our MCP (Model Context Protocol) server
- **Multi-source integration**: Pulls documentation from repositories, wikis, and documentation sites into a unified view

Whether you're working with Claude, GitHub Copilot, or other AI tools, Hyaline ensures they have access to your latest, most accurate documentation to help you build better software faster.

## Who Built Hyaline?

Hyaline is developed by [App Garden Studios](https://www.appgardenstudios.com/), a team of seasoned software engineers and technical leaders with decades of combined experience across startups and enterprise organizations. We've architected systems, led engineering teams, and experienced firsthand the productivity costs of outdated documentation.

Our team understands the technical challenges of maintaining documentation at scale, from monorepos to distributed microservices, and we've built Hyaline to solve these problems systematically.

## Our Vision for Hyaline

We're building the documentation tooling that modern development teams need. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into development workflows, having well-structured, accessible documentation becomes critical. Hyaline bridges this gap by:

- Enabling you to use your documentation regardless of where it's located
- Ensuring AI tools can access and utilize your documentation effectively
- Verifying that critical documentation exists and covers what your team actually needs
- Keeping documentation current so your documentation remain a reliable source of truth

Documentation should be a force multiplier for your team, not a maintenance overhead.

## How Do You Pronounce Hyaline?

We pronounce it "HIGH-uh-leen" â€“ meaning clear and transparent, just like we want your documentation to be.
