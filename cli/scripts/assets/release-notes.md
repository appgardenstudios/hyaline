## Before you download or use Hyaline, a few things:

- Hyaline is in an open beta that is currently free. The price and licensing structure for Hyaline has not been finalized. If you have thoughts or ideas feel free to contact [john@hyaline.dev](mailto:john@hyaline.dev).
- Hyaline uses an LLM. While Hyaline does its best to be efficient and cost sensitive, your configuration and use of Hyaline will dictate how many LLM calls Hyaline will make. Please read the [https://hyaline.dev/documentation](documentation) to understand how Hyaline works so you know what it will do. You take full responsibility for the costs incurred by your use of Hyaline.
- Hyaline is intended to assist in the identification and drafting of documentation, not to replace the sound judgment and craftsmanship of your developers and team members. Use it well.

By continuing, you acknowledge that you understand the terms above.
