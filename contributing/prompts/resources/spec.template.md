# [Feature/Change Name]

## Purpose

[DESCRIBE the primary goal of this implementation. What will users be able to do after this change is complete? Use clear, action-oriented language starting with "The purpose of this document is to define..."]

## Context

[PROVIDE background information about why this change is needed. Include:]
- [DESCRIBE any schema changes, architectural decisions, or user requirements that prompted this work]
- [LIST the key changes being introduced (use bullet points)]
- [EXPLAIN any new patterns, formats, or structures being adopted]
- [INCLUDE relevant code snippets or schema definitions if applicable]

### Reference Files

[LIST all files that should be referenced during implementation:]
- Existing implementation files: [path]
- Schema files: [path]
- Test files: [path]
- Documentation files: [path]
- [INCLUDE any other relevant reference materials]

## High-Level Objectives

[LIST 3-5 major goals that MUST be accomplished:]
- [CREATE/UPDATE/IMPLEMENT the main feature or change]
- [DESCRIBE the key functionality that must work]
- [SPECIFY what tests must be written]
- [STATE what must remain unchanged (e.g., "Leave the old implementation alone")]

## Tasks

[NUMBER each major task and use action verbs (CREATE, UPDATE, IMPLEMENT, etc.). For each task:]

1. [ACTION VERB] [what needs to be done]
   - [SUB-TASK with specific implementation details]
   - [USE imperative mood for all instructions]
   - [SPECIFY exact file paths, argument names, and formats]
   - [INCLUDE code examples or patterns when helpful]
   
2. [ACTION VERB] [next major task]
   - [DETAIL the specific changes needed]
   - [REFERENCE the old implementation as a guide but specify what's different]
   - [PROVIDE exact naming conventions, formats, or structures]

3. [IMPLEMENT/UPDATE] [specific functionality]
   - [DESCRIBE the expected behavior in detail]
   - [SPECIFY any filtering, processing, or transformation logic]
   - [INCLUDE examples of expected input/output formats]

4. [CREATE] tests
   - [SPECIFY where test files should be located]
   - [DESCRIBE how to generate test data]
   - [EXPLAIN how to run and verify tests]

## Verification

[LIST specific steps that MUST be completed before considering the work done:]
- [RUN specific tests to ensure they pass]
- [VERIFY that old functionality still works]
- [REVIEW the git diff against the specification]
- [CHECK that no unrelated changes were made]
- [ITERATE until all requirements are met]

## Notes

[INCLUDE important implementation notes, gotchas, or setup requirements:]
- [EXPLAIN any environment setup needed (e.g., loading env variables)]
- [LIST any commands that need to be run for code generation]
- [SPECIFY what should NOT be updated or modified]
- [CLARIFY any naming conventions or patterns to follow]
- [WARN about common pitfalls or mistakes to avoid]
